=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Incorporate Human Review Before Coding
Branch: auto-claude/005-human-review
Started: 2025-12-12

Note: .auto-claude/ is gitignored by design. Spec files stay local until implementation
is complete and changes are made to tracked files (auto-claude/*.py).

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a new capability that adds a human-in-the-loop checkpoint to the existing autonomous pipeline. It requires changes to the orchestration flow (spec_runner.py -> run.py handoff), new UI elements for review and approval, and persistence of review state.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json (validated - ALL CHECKPOINTS PASSED)
- Phases: 5
- Total chunks: 13
- Created init.sh
- Created context.json with pattern references

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 - Review Module Core: 3 chunks, depends on []
  - chunk-1-1: Create ReviewState dataclass
  - chunk-1-2: Add display functions for summaries
  - chunk-1-3: Add review menu and interaction

- Phase 2 - Spec Runner Integration: 3 chunks, depends on [1]
  - chunk-2-1: Add --auto-approve flag
  - chunk-2-2: Integrate review checkpoint after validation
  - chunk-2-3: Modify auto-build launch to check approval

- Phase 3 - Run.py Integration: 3 chunks, depends on [1]
  - chunk-3-1: Add approval check before build starts
  - chunk-3-2: Add --force flag to bypass approval
  - chunk-3-3: Add --review-status flag

- Phase 4 - Edge Cases and Polish: 3 chunks, depends on [2, 3]
  - chunk-4-1: Spec change detection to invalidate approvals
  - chunk-4-2: Editor integration for spec/plan editing
  - chunk-4-3: Ctrl+C graceful handling

- Phase 5 - Testing: 2 chunks, depends on [4]
  - chunk-5-1: Unit tests for ReviewState
  - chunk-5-2: Integration test for full flow

Services Involved:
- auto-claude: Core framework orchestration layer

Files to Create:
- auto-claude/review.py (new module)
- tests/test_review.py (unit tests)

Files to Modify:
- auto-claude/spec_runner.py
- auto-claude/run.py

Pattern Files Referenced:
- auto-claude/ui.py (MenuOption, select_menu, box, colors)
- auto-claude/workspace.py (WorkspaceChoice enum, finalize_workspace pattern)
- auto-claude/validate_spec.py (ValidationResult dataclass)
- auto-claude/linear_updater.py (LinearTaskState load/save pattern)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups: [Phase 2, Phase 3] - both depend only on Phase 1, modify different files
- Speedup estimate: 1.4x faster than sequential

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 005 --parallel 2

Or with single worker:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 005
